# Keylogger
Physical key logger that runs for four minutes and captures userâ€™s keystrokes
in real time. Two versions: a normal version (key logger for personal 
use with visible output to console) and a stealth version (which does not print 
to the console. Processes special characters and saves the output to a file 
with the date recorded.
